# Pacman
Pacman recreation in C++ using SFML from scratch.

Purpose:

I made this software with practicing and educational purposes only. I do not intend to make any money with my work.
As in this time I am a beginner programmer the code is not the best work you will ever see.
There are some complex logic and hard coded parts with magic numbers that will not tell much for you.

The software:

I used C++ standard and SFML libraries only. It is a console application 680x900 Window mode and 60 FPS. There are two simple game states a Menu and a Playing state.
You can choose from two game modes in the menu, the original Pacman version and an another one that has 2 new ghosts created by me.
In the original version I tried to implement the exact same original logic based on the "Pacman dossier" - google for it.
I see the biggest difference between my implementation and the original in the speed of pacman and the ghosts and I did not know the exact timing for when a fruit appears so I tried to count it manually from gameplay videos.

The two new ghosts are Luxy (the shiney one) and Darky (the dark(y) one).
How they work: Luxy likes where its dark, Darky likes to go towards shiney things. The rest you should find out by yourself (^^)

I used the original Pacman textures, some of them I drew it by myself using "pixeldraw online".
I got the original sounds from youtube.

Every file that I used for the project sounds, textures, fonts are published.

Hope you enjoy it,
have fun.
